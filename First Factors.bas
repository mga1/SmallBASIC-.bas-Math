'reload under my stuff as first math file 10/31/14
 
'modified 10/24/14 with screen displays improvement a neat general code tip!
'  for email to SmallBASIC crew and put up on GitHub
'I was challenged/inspired by the featured Primes.BAS code in SmallBASIC forum 10/18/14
'First Factors works from a different angle producing an array that is actually useful 
'for finding more than just prime numbers. Use it to factor any number up to...
'topN, I left it at 1223 because that is the 200th prime found with Primes.BAS
'on my machine and system I get .002+ or .004+ secs for 200 primes but .02+ something with Primes.BAS
'of course I've gone up to 100,000 for TopN with .2+ secs results
'The algorithm is based on Sieve of Eratostheses, 
'old as Greek Geometry with some prime number study added.
'Ha! looking up how to spell Sieve of Eratostheses I learn of Euler's Sieve (Wiki)
'n+1... there is always more that one can do, if one can do something!

' This program code is a great first tool for Number Theory Study
' I think it's pretty good for teaching SmallBASIC as well
